# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of cars based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and engine size. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model can provide accurate estimations of car prices, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about thousands of cars, including their features and corresponding prices. The dataset is collected from various sources, including car dealerships and online marketplaces.

## Features
- *Brand*: Brand or manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, BMW).
- *Model*: Model of the car (e.g., Camry, Civic, 3 Series).
- *Year*: Year of manufacture of the car.
- *Mileage*: Total mileage driven by the car.
- *Engine Size*: Engine displacement of the car in liters.
- *Fuel Type*: Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., gasoline, diesel).
- *Transmission*: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic).
- *Owner Type*: Type of ownership (e.g., first owner, second owner).
- *Location*: Location of the car (city or region).
- *Price*: Target variable, the price of the car.

## Models Used
- *Linear Regression*: Simple and interpretable baseline model.
- *Random Forest*: Ensemble method for improved predictive performance.
- *Gradient Boosting*: Boosting algorithm for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Evaluation Metrics
- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual prices.
- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*: Measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual prices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset (if necessary) and prepare the features and target variable.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the machine learning models using the training data.
4. Evaluate the models using the testing data and appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Make predictions on new data using the trained models.

## Example Code
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('car_data.csv')

# Split features and target variable
X = data.drop('Price', axis=1)
y = data['Price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)


## Future Improvements
- *Feature Engineering*: Explore additional features such as car condition, maintenance history, and optional equipment.
- *Model Ensembling*: Combine predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.
- *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
- *Data Augmentation*: Generate synthetic data points to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.
- *Deployment*: Deploy the trained model as a web service or API for real-time predictions.
